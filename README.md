# Cloud-Native-Fundamentals-Scholarship-Program-Nanodegree-Program

Summary
For this course, students should be comfortable with:

- Web application development with Python
- Using the CLI or command-line interface
- Using git commands
- Creating a DockerHub account
- These pre-requisites will be used throughout the course. Make sure you have them installed to closely follow the demos and exercise solutions.


# SUSE Cloud Native Foundations Scholarship

This is a list with the requirements for the SUSE Cloud Native Foundations Scholarship. It also has links to resources if you need to prepare for the course.

## Disclosure

All the resources in this repo are available for free on Youtube and other sites. I used most of them in order to learn these topics some time ago. Also, they are meant to be short so you can finish them soon and spend more time in the actual program.

## Requirements

- Understand the basics of http (like client, server, and internet request)
- Basic Python (data types, Functions, REST requests, web development)
- Ability to use Git, Linux machines, and Linux Command Line
- Familiar with Web application development in any language
- Familiarity with Docker and exposure to a CI/CD pipeline are not required for success in this program but are helpful skills to have.

## Resources to learn the requirements

### Basic http

- [How the internet works in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc)

- [Learn HTTP in 40 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYM2zFP3Zn0)

Pro tip: Don't worry too much if you don't understand http very well at this point. When you start learning how to develop an app using flask, these concepts will be clearer as you apply them to build a rest api. They are pretty simple after all!

### Basic Python

- [Learn Python in 2 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79MRyMsjrQ)

### Git and Linux

- [Git for complete beginners in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)

- [How to use linux on Windows - WSL2](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)

- [Linux Tutorial - Basic Command Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBokz0LTizk)

- [How to set up a fancy terminal on WSL2](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

Note: Using [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is not demanding, but installing it and setting it up is a good exercise after all.

### Developing a web application (with Flask)

- [Learn Flask in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA)
- [Articles - Learn how to connect Flask to a database](https://hackersandslackers.com/flask-sqlalchemy-database-models/)
- [Article Series - Create your first Flask application](https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application) - This is by far the best tutorial on Flask and SQLAlchemy I've ever found

### Docker

- [Learn Docker in 2 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo)

I originally forked this from Tserewara/suse-cloud-native-foundations-requirements and added my own perspective.
